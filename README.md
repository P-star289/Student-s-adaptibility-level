# Project Name : Student-s-adaptibility-level

# Project Objective: To examine student's adaptibility to virtual learning by analysing the gender, age, Education level, Institution type, Mode of learning, Network type, Location, Internet type and financial condition of 1205 students in Bangladesh.

# Data Source : The dataset used in this study is a CSV file on the adaptibility level of 1205 students in Bangladesh to online education (https://WWW.Kaggle.com/datasets/mdmahmudulhasansuzan/students-adaptibility-level-in-online-education?resource=download)

# Data Transformation: This data transformation was done using PowerBi. The data was imported, table names were changed,Null values were replaced, unnecessary Rows were removed, separated columns, merged columns, rename column headings, changed data types, and built models.

# Findings: This study shows that the class duration and age play a major role in influencing the adaptibility levels of students. Also found that Network type,load shedding and financial conditions played a partial role in the adaptibility. There were higher participation levels amongst males than females in online education.

# Recommendations : Educators should minimise the length of class duration to ensure retention and concentration levels amongst students. Subsidized internet for students, provision of laptops for students to ensure they have the equipment for online learning.
